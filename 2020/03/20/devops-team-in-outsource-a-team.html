That means I believe (or convince myself) that I lead the team (wait, wait, there will be even more obvious discoveries).\nI am sure that a team can achieve more than a single person or a group. And the story I want to tell is about making the team from a group of people with personal and non-connected tasks. I assume this is going to be a series of posts, and hopefully, I will add a table of contents here.\nA group or a team? It is quite rare to find a project that involves more than 10-15 people in a small or mid-size outsourcing company. With such project size, a single DevOps engineer is enough to handle the whole job. Or an engineer may work on several projects at the same time if projects are relatively small. This is because the scope of work to be done fits into the schedule of a single person. So it is either one-to-one or one-to-many connection in most cases: either the employee works with one project or the employee works with several projects simultaneously.\nOutsourcing a “DevOps” within this context usually means assigning an individual for the work with a client or/and a client’s team.\nNow imagine: you have several people in a room, all of them are DevOps engineers working in the same outsource company and all they work with their “own” projects separately.\nSo would you call that group of people “a team”?\nWikipedia states that “a team” is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve their [common] goal. As well as common sense tells us that “a team” is something that groups people to make them work for a mutual outcome.\nAnd here comes an obvious but a difficult question: what common goal(s) a group of people can have whereas each member of that group has its own goal, which is not related to others'? A bit contradictory, isn’t it?\nA Goal Conventional thinking tells us that a goal for the for-profit company is to make money. This is true, and I don’t want to argue with it. Therefore, does it mean that a goal for a team of engineers inside the company is the same as for the company as a whole?\nYes… Yet, not only, or almost.\nYes, because it’s the main reason why we work for an outsourcing company. We do the job for clients, clients pay the company, the company pays us.\nHowever, there is a long chain of events and processes that leads from the start of a contract to the paid invoice. A team of engineers is the inalienable part of that chain, with a focus on its work - deliver technical solutions following the client’s expectations and requirements.\nThis conclusion reveals the goal for the DevOps team in the outsourcing company: grow the quality of work by a process of ongoing improvement and refinement of technical and soft skills. So simple, so obvious.\nAnd this goal means nothing by itself. But to sustain it and adapt, to make it desirable for the team, and to make it a team’s foundation eventually, we need the following:\n Values Principles Common interests  One of the crucial responsibilities of a team lead is to foster these three pillars of a team.\nThe VALUES is something that lets us feel comfortable with the people surrounding us in the office. The list of values is not carved in stone, it can (and eventually should) change as the team evolves. But here is the most constant items for my team:\n openness in communication respect to each other’s opinion empathy feeling free to provide critic and being ready to receive it count on help from a teammate and be ready to help ability to work remotely and have flexible working hours  The PRINCIPLES is a set of beliefs and policies that keeps us on the required level of productivity and disciplines us, and stimulates the longing to improve. Again, this list can be and should be adjusted as the time goes and the team evolves, but here is the most up to date for us:\n we learn constantly we are the first who appraises the quality of our work we are proactive we are open: if we do not agree with something or something is worrying us, we should be brave enough to say it we may defend own point of view, but be ready to accept that it is incorrect we can make mistakes, but we must learn from it and do not repeat them we must help our teammates we keep our promises  The COMMON INTERESTS is more about informal things we share within a team. This includes (but not limited to) team building events, discussions and arguments about new technologies, so-called water-cooler chats, and so on. Being less formal, this pillar acts as a glue for the team. This is because we are all humans, first of all, and we generally work for 1/3 of our day (not including weekends), so we need to stay humans at work as well. I mean it is impossible to switch off the ‘human’ for that 1/3 of the day, leaving only the engineer for this time. Hence, this must be admitted and we must cope with it by putting several informal things into formal work.\nThese pillars create a team culture where learning, creativity, and an open mindset are encouraged.\nThe Team This is how a group of people with separate goals may become a team.

<p>I am sure that <strong>a team</strong> can achieve more than a single person or a group. And the story I want to tell is about making the team from a group of people with personal and non-connected tasks. I assume this is going to be a series of posts, and hopefully, I will add a table of contents here.</p>
<h3 id=a-group-or-a-team>A group or a team?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-group-or-a-team>#</a></h3>
<p>It is quite rare to find a project that involves more than 10-15 people in a small or mid-size outsourcing company. With such project size, a single DevOps engineer is enough to handle the whole job. Or an engineer may work on several projects at the same time if projects are relatively small. This is because the scope of work to be done fits into the schedule of a single person. So it is either one-to-one or one-to-many connection in most cases: either the employee works with one project or the employee works with several projects simultaneously.</p>
<p>Outsourcing a &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; within this context usually means assigning an individual for the work with a client or/and a client&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>Now imagine: you have several people in a room, all of them are DevOps engineers working in the same outsource company and all they work with their &ldquo;own&rdquo; projects separately.</p>
<p><strong>So would you call that group of people &ldquo;a team&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia states that &ldquo;a team&rdquo; is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve <strong>their [common] goal</strong>.
As well as common sense tells us that &ldquo;a team&rdquo; is something that groups people to make them work for a <strong>mutual outcome</strong>.</p>
<p>And here comes an obvious but a difficult question: what common goal(s) a group of people can have whereas each member of that group has its own goal, which is not related to others'? A bit contradictory, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<h3 id=a-goal>A Goal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-goal>#</a></h3>
<p>Conventional thinking tells us that a goal for the for-profit company is to make money. This is true, and I don&rsquo;t want to argue with it. Therefore, does it mean that a goal for a team of engineers inside the company is the same as for the company as a whole?</p>
<p>Yes&mldr; Yet, not only, or almost.</p>
<p>Yes, because it&rsquo;s the main reason why we work for an outsourcing company. We do the job for clients, clients pay the company, the company pays us.</p>
<p>However, there is a long chain of events and processes that leads from the start of a contract to the paid invoice. A team of engineers is the inalienable part of that chain, with a focus on its work - deliver technical solutions following the client&rsquo;s expectations and requirements.</p>
<p>This conclusion reveals the goal for the DevOps team in the outsourcing company: grow the quality of work by a process of ongoing improvement and refinement of technical and soft skills. So simple, so obvious.</p>
<p>And this goal means nothing by itself. But to sustain it and adapt, to make it desirable for the team, and to make it a team&rsquo;s foundation eventually, we need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values</li>
<li>Principles</li>
<li>Common interests</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the crucial responsibilities of a team lead is to foster these three pillars of a team.</p>
<p>The <strong>VALUES</strong> is something that lets us feel comfortable with the people surrounding us in the office. The list of values is not carved in stone, it can (and eventually should) change as the team evolves. But here is the most constant items for my team:</p>
<ul>
<li>openness in communication</li>
<li>respect to each other&rsquo;s opinion</li>
<li>empathy</li>
<li>feeling free to provide critic and being ready to receive it</li>
<li>count on help from a teammate and be ready to help</li>
<li>ability to work remotely and have flexible working hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>PRINCIPLES</strong> is a set of beliefs and policies that keeps us on the required level of productivity and disciplines us, and stimulates the longing to improve. Again, this list can be and should be adjusted as the time goes and the team evolves, but here is the most up to date for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>we learn constantly</li>
<li>we are the first who appraises the quality of our work</li>
<li>we are proactive</li>
<li>we are open: if we do not agree with something or something is worrying us, we should be brave enough to say it</li>
<li>we may defend own point of view, but be ready to accept that it is incorrect</li>
<li>we can make mistakes, but we must learn from it and do not repeat them</li>
<li>we must help our teammates</li>
<li>we keep our promises</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>COMMON INTERESTS</strong> is more about informal things we share within a team.
