# Activities and interests
Travel: I like to explore new cities and countries, and I also enjoy trekking and hiking. Iâ€™ve been to the Annapurna base camp, so the next stop is Everestâ€™s base camp.

Blogging: I love to blog about the technologies I use and learn at devdosvid.blog. Actively participate in technical communities as an AWS Community Builder and HashiCorp Ambassador.

Science: Fond of History, Astronomy, and Physics. I wish to see the Betelgeuse supernova explosion someday, even though the expected explosion date is between today and 100k years.
