I focused on improving our CI/CD infrastructure and supporting the professional growth of our engineering teams.

Key Achievements:

**CI/CD Improvements**: I developed the new version of the macOS CI infrastructure, which included self-service horizontal scaling and multi-architecture support. This update reduced the iOS team's CI processing times by about 40% and similarly lowered costs. I also updated our Linux-based CI infrastructure to use Kubernetes, which cut infrastructure costs by four times, reduced maintenance needs, and improved scalability.

**Educational Initiatives and Team Engagement**: I created 'Platform University,' a comprehensive learning program with tutorials and video lectures to enhance engineers' proficiency with our tools. Additionally, I led a HackWeek project that developed a quest game, improving the onboarding experience for new engineers and promoting a deeper understanding of our Engineering Platform.

**Mentorship**: I provided guidance and support to team members transitioning to the Engineering Platform team, focusing on their professional development and successful integration into our processes.

**Code Quality Initiatives**: I led the adoption of SonarQube to unify the developer experience around code style checks, test coverage, and bug detection.

**Infrastructure and Accessibility Improvements**: I developed Terraform modules that streamlined infrastructure management for static websites and single-page applications. I also conducted research to identify and address pain points in engineers‚Äô interactions with our platform, leading to targeted improvements that enhanced user experience and accessibility.

As a DevOps Coach, I delivered comprehensive training to a diverse group of participants. My classes focused on demystifying the principles of DevOps and providing practical insights into its implementation across various industries. I instructed participants on effectively integrating and collaborating within development teams, utilizing key DevOps tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker.

My teaching emphasized the technical skills and the DevOps mindset, encouraging proactive problem-solving and continuous improvement practices. This role was mutually beneficial; it allowed me to realize my aspiration of teaching while providing valuable career advancement opportunities for my students, many of whom secured new employment or promotions as a result of the training. My experience as a DevOps Coach honed my instructional abilities and deepened my understanding of how DevOps principles can be adapted and applied in different organizational contexts.
