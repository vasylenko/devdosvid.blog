Nov 2014 – Sep 2016

    I was responsible for the technical-side of processes inside the department and researching the new technologies we could implement for our clients.      Introduced ITIL practices together with our COO and, what I like the most, could change how our sysadmin's department worked with the development
    department. The work became more coordinated and more integrated.
