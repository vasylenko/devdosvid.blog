Gave DevOps classes to diverse people with different backgrounds and skillsets: sysadmins and developers from IT, students from the university, and sales managers from retail. There was one thing in common: they all wanted to know what DevOps is and how it works.

Taught them how to work inside and with the development teams and use tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker, and how to think DevOps.

It was a win-win for myself and my students: I could get a unique tutoring experience and fulfill my long-cherished dream of being a teacher, and my students gained new jobs or promotions.
