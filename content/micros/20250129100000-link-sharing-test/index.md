Found this excellent deep dive into Infrastructure as Code best practices: [Managing Infrastructure at Scale](https://example.com/infrastructure-scale) 🔗

Key takeaways:
- State management is critical for team collaboration
- Modular approach reduces complexity
- Testing infrastructure code prevents production issues

Really resonated with our recent migration experiences. The section on handling state conflicts was particularly useful.

Worth a read if you're working with Terraform or similar tools! 🚀
