Just implemented a Twitter-like micro posts feature for my Hugo blog! 🎉

This allows me to share quick thoughts, updates, and bite-sized content without the overhead of creating full blog posts. Perfect for:

- Quick development updates
- Interesting links with commentary  
- Random thoughts about tech
- Behind-the-scenes glimpses

The implementation includes a custom timeline layout, simplified creation workflow, and integration with the existing theme. Pretty excited about this addition!
