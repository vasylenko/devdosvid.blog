So you opened this page to read more about me? Thanks! I am delighted! 🤩

My name is Serhii Vasylenko and I am from Ukraine 🇺🇦. 

In my professional life, I am:
- [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=*all&awsf.location=*all&awsf.year=*all&cb-cards.q=Serhii%2BVasylenko&cb-cards.q_operator=AND)
- [HashiCorp Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/6460f36e-3b3c-4ccc-8d75-6c45fbdf58bc/public_url) 
- and Developer Experience Engineer at [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).

Technical blogging is my hobby; I also fond of astronomy and history. 

Oh, by the way, the blog name — "**devDosvid**" — is made of word "dosvid" (pronounce as [dɔsʋid]) which means "experience" in Ukrainian.\
Kinda nerdy way to name it, huh? 😄
