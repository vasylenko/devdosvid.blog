So you opened this page to read more about me? I am happy about that! 🤩

I live in Kyiv, Ukraine, but I like to travel to new, unseen places whenever I have enough time for that.

Im my professional life, I am [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=*all&awsf.location=*all&awsf.year=*all&cb-cards.q=Serhii%2BVasylenko&cb-cards.q_operator=AND), [HashiCorp Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/6460f36e-3b3c-4ccc-8d75-6c45fbdf58bc/public_url) and Developer Experience Engineer at [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).

Technical blogging is my hobby, also like to watch, read about and learn astronomy and history.\
Oh, by the way, the blog name — "devDosvid" — is made of word "dosvid" (pronounce as [dɔsʋid]) which means "experience" in Ukrainian. Kinda nerdy way to name it, huh? 😄
