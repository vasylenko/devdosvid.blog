So you opened this page to read more about me? I am very pleased!

I live in Kyiv, Ukraine, but I like to travel to new, unseen places whenever I have enough time for that.

Technical blogging is my hobby, and I am also fond of astronomy and history.

I am the [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) and Developer Experience Engineer at [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).

Also, you can find me here and there:\
