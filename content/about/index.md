So you opened this page to read more about me? Thanks! I am delighted! ðŸ¤©

My name is Serhii and I am from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. 

Im my professional life, I am:
- [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=*all&awsf.location=*all&awsf.year=*all&cb-cards.q=Serhii%2BVasylenko&cb-cards.q_operator=AND)
- [HashiCorp Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/6460f36e-3b3c-4ccc-8d75-6c45fbdf58bc/public_url) 
- and Developer Experience Engineer at [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).

Technical blogging is my hobby, also like to watch, read about and learn astronomy and history.

Oh, by the way, the blog name â€” "**devDosvid**" â€” is made of word "dosvid" (pronounce as [dÉ”sÊ‹id]) which means "experience" in Ukrainian. Kinda nerdy way to name it, huh? ðŸ˜„

If you would like to contact me, feel free to mail me at [contact@devdosvid.blog](mailto:contact@devdosvid.blog).\
Or you can find and contact me here and there:
