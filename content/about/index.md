Hello! I am Serhii, a software engineer by day and a tech enthusiast by night, currently crafting DevSecOps magic at [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

My passion lies in creating and integrating developer experience and security automation tools.\
My journey has been accompanied by leadership roles in strategic projects, which have strengthened infrastructure and boosted team efficiency.\
Curiosity fuels my days, and I believe there's always room for improvement.

And I welcome you to read more about me [in my CV](/cv)!

Technical blogging is my hobby; I am also fond of astronomy and history.

By the way, the blog name — "**devDosvid**" — is made of the word "dosvid" (pronounced as [dɔsʋid]), which means "experience" in Ukrainian. 

Feel free to connect if our paths cross, whether it's for a tech chat or a new opportunity! 🙌\
