I welcome you to read more [in my CV](/cv)!

Technical blogging is my hobby; I am also fond of astronomy and history.

By the way, the blog name â€” "**devDosvid**" â€” is made of the word "dosvid" (pronounced as [dÉ”sÊ‹id]), which means "experience" in Ukrainian. It's kind of a nerdy way to name it, huh? ðŸ˜„

If you would like to contact me, feel free to mail me at [contact@devdosvid.blog](mailto:contact@devdosvid.blog).

And I'd be happy to connect with you on these platforms:
