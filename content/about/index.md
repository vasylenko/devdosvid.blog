And if you want, you can read more [in my CV](/cv) 🤗

Technical blogging is my hobby; I also fond of astronomy and history. 

Oh, by the way, the blog name — "**devDosvid**" — is made of word "dosvid" (pronounced as [dɔsʋid]) which means "experience" in Ukrainian.\
Kinda nerdy way to name it, huh? 😄
