But how do you do that without a team reporting to you? How do you effectively involve peers in your projects, influencing their priorities when you don‚Äôt control their backlog or performance review?\nI had been looking for the answers to these questions for quite a long time, and then I realized there was no definitive answer or a straightforward rule to follow. Yet my brain always needs something systemized, and for those like me, I decided to compile this write-up: synthesis of my personal experience that worked well and learnings from books and blogs on that topic.\nThe foundation of influencing peers lies in understanding¬†their¬†perspective. Before asking someone to take on work, especially the work you‚Äôre proposing, you need to answer the fundamental question:¬†What‚Äôs in it for them?\nThis is my very first non-technical blog. And I hope it is not the last either üòÑ\nUnderstanding the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù: The Engine of Peer Collaboration Why would a fellow engineer prioritize something offered by a peer like you rather than a directive from their manager?\nIt rarely comes down to just one reason. Usually, it‚Äôs a blend of motivations deeply rooted in personal drive and effective team dynamics:\nThe Hunger for Growth \u0026 Mastery:¬†Does this task offer a chance to learn a coveted new skill, dive deeper into an interesting technology, or tackle a challenge that stretches their capabilities? Tapping into this intrinsic drive is incredibly powerful.\nThe Desire for Impact \u0026 Purpose:¬†Can you clearly articulate how this work contributes to something meaningful? Whether it‚Äôs a key product goal, squashing critical tech debt, or improving life for the whole team, connecting the task to the bigger picture gives it weight.\nThe Value of Visibility \u0026 Recognition:¬†Will this work get noticed? Could it lead to a cool demo, wider acknowledgment, or even open doors for future opportunities? Sometimes, positive exposure is a significant motivator.\nThe Power of Connection \u0026 Collaboration:¬†Is working closely with¬†you¬†part of the appeal? Offering a chance to learn directly from a respected senior peer, build rapport, and strengthen their network can be a draw in itself.\nThe Relief of Reducing Future Pain:¬†Does this task promise to automate some hard work, fix a persistent thorn in the side, or establish a pattern that saves everyone time down the line? Framing it as an investment with future payoffs can be compelling.\nThe Spark of Intrinsic Interest:¬†Sometimes, the problem itself is just plain fascinating, or it involves technology the peer genuinely enjoys working with. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of intellectual curiosity.\nThe Clarity of Strategic Alignment:¬†This is often crucial. If you can demonstrate a direct link between the task and an agreed-upon team OKR, a strategic technical initiative, or a critical product outcome, it elevates the request beyond personal preference. It becomes a¬†shared¬†priority, providing justification for them (and potentially their manager) to consider adjusting focus.\nThe Pull of a Shared Technical Vision:¬†If you‚Äôre championing a specific technical direction or architecture that resonates with your peers, they‚Äôll be more inclined to pick up tasks that help realize that vision.\nThe Currency of Reciprocity \u0026 Trust:¬†Have you built ‚Äúrelationship capital‚Äù? A history of helping others, providing timely code reviews, and tackling unglamorous tasks yourself makes peers more likely to reciprocate when you offer an opportunity or ask for help.\nThe Strength of a Collaborative Culture:¬†In healthy teams, there‚Äôs an inherent understanding that helping each other and sharing interesting work benefits everyone. Your offer reinforces this positive norm.\nUnderstanding these potential ‚ÄúWhys‚Äù is your key. Now, how do you translate that understanding into effectively approaching your peers? Subscribe to blog updates! No spam or promotions, or other crap. Just a gentle update when I publish a new post.\nCrafting the Opportunity: Making the Ask Compelling Knowing the potential motivators allows you to frame your request not as an ask for help but as presenting a valuable opportunity.\nFrame Based on Mutual Benefit:¬†Tailor your pitch. Does this task primarily offer¬†growth? Highlight the learning potential. Is it about¬†impact? Emphasize its strategic importance. Does it align with their known¬†interests? Point that out. Frame it as a chance for partnership or mentorship if that fits.\nLower the Barrier to Entry:¬†Make it easy to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù (or at least ‚Äútell me more‚Äù). Do the heavy lifting: clearly define the problem, provide essential context, perhaps outline potential approaches, and have a task ready in your tracker. Reduce the initial friction and cognitive load. A well-defined, manageable scope is far less daunting than a vague, massive undertaking.\nEmpower, Don‚Äôt Micromanage:¬†Offer challenging work that genuinely stretches capabilities. Provide clear context and constraints (the ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù). Then ‚Äì critically ‚Äì give them the space to figure things out. Use check-ins and discussions about success criteria as support mechanisms, not control tactics. Explicitly state¬†why¬†you think this is a good opportunity for¬†their¬†development.\nBuild and Leverage Trust:¬†This is paramount and underpins everything else when evolved. Your technical credibility and relationship capital are essential. Peers are more likely to engage when they:\nTrust the Problem \u0026 Direction:¬†They believe the problem is worth solving, and your proposed path (or the space you give them to find one) is sound.\nTrust Your Motives:¬†They believe you‚Äôre genuinely offering this for¬†their¬†growth and the project‚Äôs benefit, not just offloading grunt work. Your history of collaboration, giving credit, and supporting others builds this trust.\nTrust Your Support:¬†They believe you‚Äôll provide necessary context, answer questions, help unblock them, and shield them from related distractions.\nOf course, even the best-framed opportunity might meet a scheduling conflict. What happens when the answer is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm swamped, I can‚Äôt‚Äù?\nNavigating the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (or ‚ÄúNot Now‚Äù) Hearing ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have bandwidth‚Äù is common and perfectly okay. How you respond matters for the long-term relationship and potential future collaboration.\nValidate \u0026 Understand First:¬†Always start by acknowledging their situation.\n‚ÄúOkay, totally understand you‚Äôre busy.‚Äù\nThen, gently probe to distinguish bandwidth issues from lack of interest or alignment: ‚ÄúJust so I understand better, is the main challenge fitting it in time-wise alongside existing priorities, or does this opportunity maybe not feel like the right fit/priority compared to what‚Äôs on your plate?‚Äù\nAdapt the Ask:¬†If bandwidth is the¬†only¬†issue, can the scope be reduced? Is there a smaller, valuable piece they¬†could¬†contribute (e.g., brainstorming, reviewing a design, tackling one specific sub-task)?\nAlign Priorities Collaboratively (Handle with Care):¬†If the task is strategically important, the peer¬†is¬†interested, but they‚Äôre blocked by conflicting priorities, this is where careful alignment is needed.\nCrucially: Get Peer Buy-in First:¬†Never go directly to their manager without discussing it with your peer first. Doing so instantly undermines trust. Instead, frame the idea of talking to the manager¬†together¬†as a way to seek support for¬†their¬†growth and achieve important¬†shared¬†team/organization goals. It is also OK to talk to their manager one-on-one; just confirm that with your peer first. The same goes if your peer says they will do that. The main point is that you talked to your peer first, and you agreed to continue.\nFrame the Manager Conversation:¬†If you¬†do¬†talk to the manager¬†with¬†your peer, focus on shared objectives. ‚ÄúWe identified this task as crucial for [Goal X]. [Peer Name] is interested, and it seems like a great growth opportunity. Given their current commitments, how can we best align priorities to make this feasible?‚Äù This turns it into collaborative problem-solving, not top-down pressure.\nRespect Boundaries:¬†If the answer remains ‚Äúno,‚Äù accept it gracefully. Thank them for considering it. Preserving the relationship is key for future influence.\nSeek Alternatives:¬†If it‚Äôs not feasible, consider other peers. Can you tackle a smaller version of this task yourself? Is it worth deferring (sometimes rethinking reveals it wasn‚Äôt as critical as initially thought)?\nCreating specific task-based opportunities is powerful, but scaling your impact as a senior IC involves broader strategies too.\nBroader Strategies for Scaling Your Impact Beyond direct ‚Äúdelegation-as-opportunity,‚Äù think about these leverage points:\nMentorship \u0026 Sponsorship:¬†Formalize the growth angle. Move beyond ad-hoc tasks to explicitly mentor someone through a larger piece of work. Actively sponsor them by highlighting their contributions and advocating for their visibility.\nCreating Leverage via Platforms, Tools, \u0026 Frameworks:¬†Build things that make¬†many¬†engineers more effective. A robust library, a streamlined CI/CD pipeline, and a well-designed service template ‚Äì that scale your impact exponentially without direct task delegation. You‚Äôre essentially ‚Äúdelegating‚Äù efficiency and good practices.\nEstablishing Patterns and Best Practices:¬†Defining and evangelizing clear architectural patterns, coding standards, or review processes guide the work of many, scaling your influence on quality, consistency, and maintainability. You‚Äôre shaping¬†how¬†work gets done.\nArchitectural Guidance and Technical Strategy:¬†Setting a clear, well-communicated technical direction influences the choices and priorities of the entire team or organization, ensuring efforts align towards a cohesive vision.\nEffective Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:¬†Writing clear design documents, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), runbooks, and tutorials enable others to understand systems, contribute effectively, and operate autonomously within the technical landscape you‚Äôve helped shape.\nTime to Try: Practical Exercises Two practical exercises to go and try.\nFind a Growth Opportunity Scan your current or upcoming workload. Identify one item that isn‚Äôt just work to be done but represents a genuine development opportunity for a specific colleague. Think about¬†why¬†it‚Äôs a good fit for¬†them.\nThen, practice framing it as an opportunity, highlighting their potential gains (learning, impact, interest). Prepare the context they‚Äôd need, and be ready to offer mentorship, not micromanagement. Anticipate how you‚Äôd handle a ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù response using the adaptive strategies.\nPitch Strategic Alignment Identify a task (on your plate or the team‚Äôs radar) that directly supports a key team or organizational goal (e.g., an OKR, a critical roadmap item, fixing a major pain point).\nClearly articulate¬†why¬†this task is strategically important ‚Äì quantify its impact if possible. Mentally select a relevant peer and craft a concise pitch focusing¬†first¬†on the task‚Äôs alignment with shared objectives and its broader impact,¬†then¬†on the technical details or learning aspects.\nCrucially, plan how you would suggest a collaborative discussion about priority alignment (potentially involving their manager,¬†with their consent) if they express interest but cite conflicting priorities due to the task‚Äôs strategic value.\nAfterword: Influence is the Goal Scaling your impact as an individual contributor isn‚Äôt about wielding authority you don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs about building¬†influence, trust, and shared understanding.¬†You leverage your technical credibility, strategic thinking, and relationship capital to create opportunities that are genuinely valuable for your peers while advancing collective goals.\nPeers engage not because they¬†have¬†to but because they¬†want¬†to ‚Äì driven by growth, impact, interest, or trust in you and the mission.\nPrioritization becomes a conversation about value and strategic alignment, sometimes requiring collaborative discussions with managers, rather than a zero-sum game.\nYes, this takes conscious effort. It requires empathy, clear communication, and sometimes navigating tricky conversations.\nBut ‚Äúthis is the path‚Äù because focusing on building trust, clearly articulating the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù connecting tasks to strategic goals, and genuinely investing in the growth of those around you is the essence of being a force multiplier as a senior IC.\nNaturally, every team and individual is different, so consider these strategies a starting point or a toolkit to adapt to your unique context.\nBooks on this topic:\nWill Larson‚Äôs ‚ÄúStaff Engineer‚Äù and ‚ÄúAn Elegant Puzzle‚Äù, Camille Fournier‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Manager‚Äôs Path‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Software Engineer‚Äôs Guidebook‚Äù by Gergely Orosz, ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù by Daniel Pink for concepts around influence and motivation Blogs on this and many other great things:\n‚ÄúA Life Engineered‚Äù by Steve Huynh https://alifeengineered.substack.com/ ‚ÄúPragmatic Engineer‚Äù by Gergely Orosz https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about ","wordCount":"1996","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://devdosvid.blog/2025/04/04/delegate-for-growth-scaling-your-impact-through-others/cover.jpeg","datePublished":"2025-04-04T00:36:23+02:00","dateModified":"2025-04-13T15:55:55+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Serhii Vasylenko"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://devdosvid.blog/2025/04/04/delegate-for-growth-scaling-your-impact-through-others/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"devDosvid blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://devdosvid.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/ accesskey=h title="üè† Home (Alt + H)">üè† Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/index.xml title="RSS Feed"><span>RSS Feed</span></a></li><li><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/archive title="All posts"><span>All posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/about/ title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/series title="Post Series"><span>Post Series</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://devdosvid.blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://devdosvid.blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Delegate for Growth: Scaling Your Impact Through Others</h1><div class=post-description>Senior IC guide to scaling impact.

Explicitly state¬†why¬†you think this is a good opportunity for¬†their¬†development.</p><p><strong>Build and Leverage Trust:</strong>¬†This is paramount and underpins everything else when evolved. Your technical credibility and relationship capital are essential. Peers are more likely to engage when they:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trust the Problem & Direction:</strong>¬†They believe the problem is worth solving, and your proposed path (or the space you give them to find one) is sound.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trust Your Motives:</strong>¬†They believe you&rsquo;re genuinely offering this for¬†their¬†growth and the project&rsquo;s benefit, not just offloading grunt work. Your history of collaboration, giving credit, and supporting others builds this trust.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trust Your Support:</strong>¬†They believe you&rsquo;ll provide necessary context, answer questions, help unblock them, and shield them from related distractions.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, even the best-framed opportunity might meet a scheduling conflict. What happens when the answer is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m swamped, I can&rsquo;t&rdquo;?</p><h2 id=navigating-the-no-or-not-now>Navigating the &ldquo;No&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Not Now&rdquo;)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#navigating-the-no-or-not-now>#</a></h2><p>Hearing &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have bandwidth&rdquo; is common and perfectly okay. How you <strong>respond matters</strong> for the long-term relationship and potential future collaboration.</p><p><strong>Validate & Understand First:</strong>¬†Always start by acknowledging their situation.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Okay, totally understand you&rsquo;re busy.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Then, gently probe to distinguish bandwidth issues from lack of interest or alignment: &ldquo;<em>Just so I understand better, is the main challenge fitting it in time-wise alongside existing priorities, or does this opportunity maybe not feel like the right fit/priority compared to what&rsquo;s on your plate?</em>&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Adapt the Ask:</strong>¬†If bandwidth is the¬†only¬†issue, can the scope be reduced? Is there a smaller, valuable piece they¬†could¬†contribute (e.g., brainstorming, reviewing a design, tackling one specific sub-task)?</p><p><strong>Align Priorities Collaboratively (Handle with Care):</strong>¬†If the task is strategically important, the peer¬†is¬†interested, but they&rsquo;re blocked by conflicting priorities, this is where careful alignment is needed.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Crucially: Get Peer Buy-in First:</strong>¬†Never go directly to their manager without discussing it with your peer first.
Doing so instantly undermines trust. Instead, frame the idea of talking to the manager¬†together¬†as a way to seek support for¬†their¬†growth and achieve important¬†shared¬†team/organization goals. It is also OK to talk to their manager one-on-one; just confirm that with your peer first. The same goes if your peer says they will do that. The main point is that you talked to your peer first, and you agreed to continue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frame the Manager Conversation:</strong>¬†If you¬†do¬†talk to the manager¬†with¬†your peer, focus on shared objectives.
&ldquo;<em>We identified this task as crucial for [Goal X]. [Peer Name] is interested, and it seems like a great growth opportunity. Given their current commitments, how can we best align priorities to make this feasible?</em>&rdquo; This turns it into collaborative problem-solving, not top-down pressure.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Respect Boundaries:</strong>¬†If the answer remains &ldquo;no,&rdquo; accept it gracefully. Thank them for considering it. Preserving the relationship is key for future influence.</p><p><strong>Seek Alternatives:</strong>¬†If it&rsquo;s not feasible, consider other peers. Can you tackle a smaller version of this task yourself? Is it worth deferring (sometimes rethinking reveals it wasn&rsquo;t as critical as initially thought)?</p><p>Creating specific task-based opportunities is powerful, but scaling your impact as a senior IC involves broader strategies too.</p><h2 id=broader-strategies-for-scaling-your-impact>Broader Strategies for Scaling Your Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#broader-strategies-for-scaling-your-impact>#</a></h2><p>Beyond direct &ldquo;delegation-as-opportunity,&rdquo; think about these leverage points:</p><p><strong>Mentorship & Sponsorship:</strong>¬†Formalize the growth angle. Move beyond ad-hoc tasks to explicitly mentor someone through a larger piece of work. Actively sponsor them by highlighting their contributions and advocating for their visibility.</p><p><strong>Creating Leverage via Platforms, Tools, & Frameworks:</strong>¬†Build things that make¬†many¬†engineers more effective. A robust library, a streamlined CI/CD pipeline, and a well-designed service template ‚Äì that scale your impact exponentially without direct task delegation. You&rsquo;re essentially &ldquo;delegating&rdquo; efficiency and good practices.</p><p><strong>Establishing Patterns and Best Practices:</strong>¬†Defining and evangelizing clear architectural patterns, coding standards, or review processes guide the work of many, scaling your influence on quality, consistency, and maintainability. You&rsquo;re shaping¬†how¬†work gets done.</p><p><strong>Architectural Guidance and Technical Strategy:</strong>¬†Setting a clear, well-communicated technical direction influences the choices and priorities of the entire team or organization, ensuring efforts align towards a cohesive vision.</p><p><strong>Effective Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:</strong>¬†Writing clear design documents, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), runbooks, and tutorials enable others to understand systems, contribute effectively, and operate autonomously within the technical landscape you&rsquo;ve helped shape.</p><h2 id=time-to-try-practical-exercises>Time to Try: Practical Exercises<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#time-to-try-practical-exercises>#</a></h2><p>Two practical exercises to go and try.</p><h3 id=find-a-growth-opportunity>Find a Growth Opportunity<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#find-a-growth-opportunity>#</a></h3><p>Scan your current or upcoming workload. Identify one item that isn&rsquo;t just work to be done but represents a genuine development opportunity for a specific colleague. Think about¬†why¬†it&rsquo;s a good fit for¬†them.</p><p>Then, practice framing it as an opportunity, highlighting their potential gains (learning, impact, interest). Prepare the context they&rsquo;d need, and be ready to offer mentorship, not micromanagement. Anticipate how you&rsquo;d handle a &ldquo;too busy&rdquo; response using the adaptive strategies.</p><h3 id=pitch-strategic-alignment>Pitch Strategic Alignment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pitch-strategic-alignment>#</a></h3><p>Identify a task (on your plate or the team&rsquo;s radar) that directly supports a key team or organizational goal (e.g., an OKR, a critical roadmap item, fixing a major pain point).</p><p>Clearly articulate¬†why¬†this task is strategically important ‚Äì quantify its impact if possible. Mentally select a relevant peer and craft a concise pitch focusing¬†first¬†on the task&rsquo;s alignment with shared objectives and its broader impact,¬†then¬†on the technical details or learning aspects.</p><p>Crucially, plan how you would suggest a collaborative discussion about priority alignment (potentially involving their manager,¬†with their consent) if they express interest but cite conflicting priorities due to the task&rsquo;s strategic value.</p><h2 id=afterword-influence-is-the-goal>Afterword: Influence is the Goal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#afterword-influence-is-the-goal>#</a></h2><p>Scaling your impact as an individual contributor isn&rsquo;t about wielding authority you don&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s about building¬†<strong>influence, trust, and shared understanding.</strong>¬†You leverage your technical credibility, strategic thinking, and relationship capital to create opportunities that are genuinely valuable for your peers while advancing collective goals.</p><p>Peers engage not because they¬†have¬†to but because they¬†want¬†to ‚Äì driven by growth, impact, interest, or trust in you and the mission.</p><p>Prioritization becomes a conversation about value and strategic alignment, sometimes requiring collaborative discussions with managers, rather than a zero-sum game.</p><p>Yes, this takes conscious effort. It requires empathy, clear communication, and sometimes navigating tricky conversations.</p><p>But &ldquo;this <strong>is</strong> the path&rdquo; because focusing on building trust, clearly articulating the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; connecting tasks to strategic goals, and genuinely investing in the growth of those around you is the essence of being a force multiplier as a senior IC.</p><p>Naturally, every team and individual is different, so consider these strategies a <strong>starting</strong> point or a toolkit to adapt to your unique context.</p><div class=attention><p>Books on this topic:</p><ul><li>Will Larson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Staff Engineer&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Elegant Puzzle&rdquo;,</li><li>Camille Fournier&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Manager&rsquo;s Path&rdquo;,</li><li>&ldquo;The Software Engineer&rsquo;s Guidebook&rdquo; by Gergely Orosz,</li><li>&ldquo;Drive&rdquo; by Daniel Pink for concepts around influence and motivation</li></ul><p>Blogs on this and many other great things:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;A Life Engineered&rdquo; by Steve Huynh <a href=https://alifeengineered.substack.com/>https://alifeengineered.substack.com/</a></li><li>&ldquo;Pragmatic Engineer&rdquo; by Gergely Orosz <a href=https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about>https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=beehiiv-subscribe-container><h3>Subscribe to blog updates!</h3><iframe src="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/60009a3f-3202-4ac0-85f8-0d3db1ea781b?slim=true" data-test-id=beehiiv-embed height=52 frameborder=0 scrolling=no style=margin:0;border-radius:0!important;background-color:transparent></iframe><p>No spam or promotions, or other crap.
