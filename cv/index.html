developer productivity. Proven expertise in architecting and leading complex initiatives, such as reducing critical vulnerabilities by 59% across 70+ services (CISO priority) and saving $500K+ annually via CI/CD optimization (Kubernetes). My impact bridges infrastructure and security domains, balancing robust system design with operational excellence and developer velocity. I am a passionate mentor dedicated to building high-performing teams and enabling engineers to lead independently.\nExperience Staff Engineer, Infrastructure \u0026 Security, Grammarly, 11/2020 - Present Reduced critical vulnerabilities by 59% by designing and leading the Supply Chain Security project (CISO’s top priority) and implementing end-to-end security controls across 70 production services owned by 14 teams while maintaining a seamless developer experience with guided break-glass procedures. Led a team of 5 ICs through the project lifecycle. Led the delivery of the foundational K8s-based Infrastructure and CI/CD stack for the strategic Customer Cloud initiative, directly supporting company OKRs for enterprise market expansion. Led a team of 4 ICs through the project lifecycle. Proactively identified inefficiencies and architected a new Kubernetes-based CI infrastructure for backend services teams, achieving $500K+ annual CI cost savings while enhancing scalability and developer self-service. Led and architected the implementation of scalable CI infrastructure for mobile and desktop client teams, delivering 40% faster CI builds and 35% cost savings for iOS/macOS teams and improving cross-functional developer productivity. Drove improvements in security operations by formalizing vulnerability management processes and optimizing CI security tooling, reducing critical job failures from 30% to 4.5%. Created and launched ‘Platform University’, a comprehensive onboarding program including documentation and hands-on labs, reducing platform ramp-up time for new engineers from 4 weeks to 1 week. Led the integration of key developer productivity tools (Sourcegraph, GitHub Copilot), adopted by ~220 engineers monthly and recognized as top internal enhancements. Contributed strategically to talent acquisition by conducting System Design/SRE interviews for senior roles and designing specialized interview formats for critical infrastructure roles. Enabled direct reports to lead complex initiatives independently by mentoring and leading teams of two to five engineers. DevOps Coach, Hillel IT School, part-time, 06/2020 - 04/2023 Achieved an 85% job placement rate for graduates by delivering practical DevOps training focused on industry-relevant skills and technologies. Developed and delivered a comprehensive curriculum covering CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, cloud architecture, and container orchestration. Created hands-on AWS lab environments to provide students with practical experience in cloud infrastructure management. Maintained a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating across all training sessions while adapting teaching methods to diverse learning styles and technical backgrounds. Engineering Manager, IT Craft, 03/2017 - 06/2020 Scaled engineering team from 1 to 8 engineers while successfully delivering 40+ projects, demonstrating effective talent acquisition and project management. Created a new revenue stream by establishing the ‘DevOps as a Service’ business model, revolutionizing the department’s approach to client engagement. Improved organizational visibility by tripling cross-department project collaboration through enhanced team reputation and cross-functional partnerships. Developed a technical leadership pipeline by mentoring junior engineers into senior contributors through structured development programs.
