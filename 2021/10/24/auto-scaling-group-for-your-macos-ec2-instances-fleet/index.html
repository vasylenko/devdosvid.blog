Or it has been complicated until recent days.\nOfficial / Unofficial Auto Scaling for macOS With a growing number of instances, the following challenges arise:\n Scale mac1.metal instances horizontally Automatically allocate and release Dedicated Hosts needed for instances Automatically replace unhealthy instances  If you have worked with AWS before, you know that Auto Scaling Group service can solve such things.\nHowever, official documentation (as of October 2021) states: “You cannot use Mac instances with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling”.\nBut in fact, you can.\nCombining services to get real power So how does all that work?\nLet’s review the diagram that illustrates the interconnection between involved services:\n  Services logical interconnection\n  With the help of Licence Manager service and Launch Templates, you can set up EC2 Auto Scaling Group for mac1.metal and leave the automated instance provisioning to the service.\nLicense Configuration First, you need to create a License Configuration so that the Host resource group can allocate the hots.\nGo to AWS License Manager - Customer managed licenses - Create customer-managed license.\nSpecify Sockets as the Licence type. You may skip setting the Number of Sockets. However, the actual limit of mac1.metal instances per account is regulated by Service Quota. The default number of mac instances allowed per account is 3. Therefore, consider increasing this to a more significant number.\n  Licence configuration values\n  Host resource group Second, create the Host resource group: AWS License Manager - Host resource groups - Create host resource group.\nWhen creating the Host resource group, check “Allocate hosts automatically” and “Release hosts automatically” but leave “Recover hosts automatically” unchecked. Dedicated Host does not support host recovery for mac1.metal. However, Auto Scaling Group will maintain the desired number of instances if one fails the health check (which assumes the case of host failure as well).\nAlso, I recommend specifying “mac1” as an allowed Instance family for the sake of transparent resource management: only this instance type is permitted to allocate hosts in the group.\n  Host resource group configuration values\n  Optionally, you may specify the license association here (the Host group will pick any compatible license) or select the license you created on step one.\nLaunch Template Create Launch Template: EC2 - Launch templates - Create launch template.\nI will skip the description of all Launch Template parameters (but here is a nice tutorial), if you don’t mind, and keep focus only on the items relevant to the current case.\nSpecify mac1.metal as the Instance type. Later, in Advanced details: find the Tenancy parameter and set it to “Dedicated host”; for Target host by select “Host resource group”, and once selected the new parameter Tenancy host resource group will appear where you should choose your host group; select your license in License configurations parameter.\n  Launch Template configuration values\n  Auto Scaling Group Finally, create the Auto Scaling Group: EC2 - Auto Scaling groups - Create Auto Scaling group.\nThe vital thing to note here — is the availability of the mac1.metal instance in particular AZ.\nMac instances are available in us-east-1 and 7 more regions, but not every Availability Zone in the region supports it. So you must figure out which AZ supports the needed instance type.\nThere is no documentation for that, but there is an AWS CLI command that can answer this question: describe-instance-type-offerings — AWS CLI 2.3.0 Command Reference\nHere is an example for the us-east-1 region: 🔍 Click here to see the code snippet  aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --location-type availability-zone-id --filters Name=instance-type,Values=mac1.metal --region us-east-1 --output text INSTANCETYPEOFFERINGS\tmac1.metal\tuse1-az6\tavailability-zone-id INSTANCETYPEOFFERINGS\tmac1.metal\tuse1-az4\tavailability-zone-id  \nKeep that nuance in mind when selecting a subnet for the mac1.metal instances.\nWhen you know the AZ, specify the respective Subnet in the Auto Scaling Group settings, and you’re ready to go!\nBring Infrastructure as Code here I suggest describing all that as a code. I prefer Terraform, and its AWS provider supports the needed resources. Except one.\nAs of October 2021, resources supported :\n aws_servicequotas_service_quota aws_licensemanager_license_configuration aws_launch_template aws_autoscaling_group  The Host resource group is not yet supported by the provider, unfortunately. However, we can use CloudFormation in Terraform to overcome that: describe the Host resource group as aws_cloudformation_stack Terraform resource using CloudFormation template from a file.\nHere is how it looks like: 🔍 Click here to see the code snippet resource \"aws_licensemanager_license_configuration\" \"this\" { name = local.full_name license_counting_type = \"Socket\" } resource \"aws_cloudformation_stack\" \"this\" { name = local.full_name# the name of CloudFormation stack  template_body = file(\"${path.module}/resource-group-cf-stack-template.json\") parameters = { GroupName = local.full_name# the name for the Host group, passed to CloudFormation template  } on_failure = \"DELETE\" }  \nAnd the next code snippet explains the CloudFromation template (which is the resource-group-cf-stack-template.json file in the code snippet above)\n🔍 Click here to see the code snippet { \"Parameters\" : { \"GroupName\" : { \"Type\" : \"String\", \"Description\" : \"The name of Host Group\" } }, \"Resources\" : { \"DedicatedHostGroup\": { \"Type\": \"AWS::ResourceGroups::Group\", \"Properties\": { \"Name\": { \"Ref\": \"GroupName\" }, \"Configuration\": [ { \"Type\": \"AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic\", \"Parameters\": [ { \"Name\": \"allowed-resource-types\", \"Values\": [\"AWS::EC2::Host\"] }, { \"Name\": \"deletion-protection\", \"Values\": [\"UNLESS_EMPTY\"] } ] }, { \"Type\": \"AWS::EC2::HostManagement\", \"Parameters\": [ { \"Name\": \"allowed-host-families\", \"Values\": [\"mac1\"] }, { \"Name\": \"auto-allocate-host\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Name\": \"auto-release-host\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Name\": \"any-host-based-license-configuration\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] } ] } ] } } }, \"Outputs\" : { \"ResourceGroupARN\" : { \"Description\": \"ResourceGroupARN\", \"Value\" : { \"Fn::GetAtt\" : [\"DedicatedHostGroup\", \"Arn\"] } } } }  \nThe aws_cloudformation_stack resource will export the DedicatedHostGroup attribute (see the code of CloudFromation template), which you will use later in the Launch Template resource.\nPro tips If you manage an AWS Organization, I have good news: Host groups and Licenses are supported by Resource Access Manager service. Hence, you can host all mac instances in one account and share them with other accounts — it might be helpful for costs allocation, for example. Also, check out my blog about AWS RAM if you are very new to this service.\nTo solve the “which AZ supports mac metal” puzzle, you can leverage the aws_ec2_instance_type_offerings and aws_subnet_ids data sources.\nCosts considerations License Manager is a free of charge service, as well as Auto Scaling, and Launch Template.\nSo it’s all about the price for mac1.metal Dedicated Host which is $1.083 per hour as of October 2021. However, Saving Plans can be applied.\nPlease note that the minimum allocation time for that type of host is 24 hours. Maybe someday AWS will change that to 1-hour minimum someday (fingers crossed).\nOh. So. ASG. The Auto Scaling for mac1.metal opens new possibilities for CI/CD: you can integrate that to your favorite tool (GitLab, Jenkins, whatsoever) using AWS Lambda and provision new instances when your development/testing environments need that. Or you can use other cool ASG stuff, such as Lifecycle hooks, to create even more custom scenarios.\nConsidering the “hidden” (undocumented) nature of the described setup, I suggest treating it as rather testing than production-ready for now. However, my tests show that everything works pretty well: hosts are allocated, instances are spawned, and the monthly bill grows.\nI suppose AWS will officially announce all this in the nearest future. Along with that, I am looking forward to the announcement of Monterey-based AMIs and maybe even M1 chip-based instances (will it be mac2.metal?).\nAnd I want to say thanks (thanks, pal!) to OliverKoo, who started digging into that back in April'21.\n","wordCount":"1314","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/10/24/auto-scaling-group-for-your-macos-ec2-instances-fleet/cover-image.png","datePublished":"2021-10-24T02:00:31+03:00","dateModified":"2021-10-24T02:00:31+03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Serhii Vasylenko"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/10/24/auto-scaling-group-for-your-macos-ec2-instances-fleet/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Serhii Vasylenko","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://serhii.vasylenko.info/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://serhii.vasylenko.info accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://serhii.vasylenko.info/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=" 30px">Home</a>

Hence, you can host all mac instances in one account and share them with other accounts — it might be helpful for costs allocation, for example. Also, check out <a href=https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/09/25/aws-resource-access-manager-multi-account-resource-governance/>my blog about AWS RAM</a> if you are very new to this service.</p><p>To solve the “which AZ supports mac metal” puzzle, you can leverage the <a href=https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/ec2_instance_type_offerings>aws_ec2_instance_type_offerings</a> and <a href=https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/subnet_ids>aws_subnet_ids</a> data sources.</p><h2 id=costs-considerations>Costs considerations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#costs-considerations>#</a></h2><p>License Manager is a <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/license-manager/pricing/>free of charge service</a>, as well as <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/pricing/>Auto Scaling</a>, and <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-launch-templates-for-amazon-ec2-instances/>Launch Template</a>.</p><p>So it’s all about the price for mac1.metal Dedicated Host which is <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing/>$1.083 per hour</a> as of October 2021. However, <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html>Saving Plans</a> can be applied.</p><p>Please note that the minimum allocation time for that type of host is 24 hours. Maybe someday AWS will change that to 1-hour minimum someday (fingers crossed).</p><h2 id=oh-so-asg>Oh. So. ASG.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#oh-so-asg>#</a></h2><p>The Auto Scaling for mac1.metal opens new possibilities for CI/CD: you can integrate that to your favorite tool (GitLab, Jenkins, whatsoever) using AWS Lambda and provision new instances when your development/testing environments need that. Or you can use other cool ASG stuff, such as Lifecycle hooks, to create even more custom scenarios.</p><p>Considering the “hidden” (undocumented) nature of the described setup, I suggest treating it as rather testing than production-ready for now. However, my tests show that everything works pretty well: hosts are allocated, instances are spawned, and the monthly bill grows.</p><p>I suppose AWS will officially announce all this in the nearest future. Along with that, I am looking forward to the announcement of Monterey-based AMIs and maybe even M1 chip-based instances (will it be mac2.metal?).</p><p>And I want to say thanks (thanks, pal!) to <a href=https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28531>OliverKoo</a>, who started digging into that back in April'21.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=write_me_on_twitter><p>Send me a message <a href=https://twitter.com/vasylenko>@vasylenko</a> on Twitter with your feedback or questions!</p></div><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://serhii.vasylenko.info/tags/aws/>aws</a></li><li><a href=https://serhii.vasylenko.info/tags/architecture/>architecture</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/11/05/apply-cloudfront-security-headers-with-terraform/><span class=title>« Prev Page</span><br><span>Apply Cloudfront Security Headers With Terraform</span></a>
